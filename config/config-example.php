        /* ── Page Editor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
           Enables the per-page editor. Access any page with ?editor or
           ?editor=yourtoken appended to the URL.

           SETUP:
           1. Generate a password hash — create a temp PHP file containing:
                  <?php echo password_hash('yourpassword', PASSWORD_BCRYPT); ?>
              Visit it once, copy the output, delete the file.
              Paste the result into $editorPasswordHash below.

           2. Set $editorToken to a long random string. This must be included
              in the URL to even reach the login form:
                  yoursite.com/about?editor=yourtoken
              Generate one with: php -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(16));"
              Leave empty ('') to disable the URL token check (not recommended).

           3. Set $editorEnabled = true.

           4. On production (HTTPS), session cookies are automatically flagged
              Secure and HttpOnly. On local HTTP development this is fine as-is.

           Set $editorEnabled = false to completely disable the editor.
           When false, zero editor code runs anywhere on the site.

           TWO-FACTOR (OPTIONAL):
           $editorTotpSecret adds a six-digit code from an authenticator app on
           top of the password. It is OFF by default — leave it as an empty
           string and the editor behaves exactly as it always has, with no code
           field on the login form and nothing extra to configure.

           To switch it on, **log into the editor as normal** and **then** visit:
                  yoursite.com/about?editor=yourtoken&totp=setup
           That screen generates a secret, shows a QR code to scan, lets you
           confirm your app agrees before you commit, and prints the line to
           paste back here. Set it back to '' to switch two-factor off again.

           No third-party service is involved. Your authenticator app and this
           file each hold the same secret and each compute the same code from
           the current time — nothing is exchanged, and neither side needs an
           internet connection.

           The value must be Base32 (the letters A-Z and the digits 2-7 only).
           A plain passphrase will not work: authenticator apps decode what you
           type as Base32 before hashing it, so the bytes would not match.

           IMPORTANT: unlike the password, this secret cannot be hashed. The
           server needs the real value in order to recompute codes, so it sits
           here in plain text. Keep config/.htaccess in place, and keep a copy
           of the secret somewhere safe — if you lose your phone, the only way
           back in is to blank this value over FTP or SSH.
